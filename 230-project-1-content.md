## I. High Concept
Use one of these techniques:
   "It's Jelly Bombs of Doom but you can drop bombs to destroy bigger enemies with bombs!"

## II. Genre

Action, Casual, Avoidance, Eat or Be Eaten

## III. Platform
Desktop. 

## IV. Story

Some games are purely abstract and have no story or theme (ex. Tetris).

But most games at least have a premise to define the action (ex. Your avatar is running from ghosts in a maze).

For your proposed game, discuss the theme (big ideas - if applicable), mood (excitement, fear, ?), narrative (how the player progresses through the game), and premise of the game (what drives the plot).

Also discuss player motivation. Give a short summary of what the player is trying to accomplish in the game. Some of this will be recycled from the High Concept section above.
## V. Aesthetics

Graphics style - Cartoonish
Sound - Ambient

Scoring Sound-
Death Sound-
Eating Sound-
Background Sound-

## VI. Gameplay
Mechanics

What specific choices can the player make and what can they do?

Here are some compilations of game mechanics you might find helpful:

    squidi.net/three/
    SCVNGR game mechanics or as Flashcards
    gamification.org - Game Mechanics

Control

Be specific, here are many of the options:

Drop Bomb - Space Bar
Move Left - Left Arrow Key, A
Move Right - Right Arrow Key, D
Move Up - Up Arrow Key, W
Move Down - Down Arrow Key, S
 

Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"

How is the player taught how to play the game? Is this integrated into the gameplay, are there separate instructional scenes, a tutorial, or some combination? Is it obvious to the player how to play the game? See Cascading Information Theory on the SCVNGR game mechanics page.
Player learning

Explain some of what the player needs to learn to beat the game. Be specific and cite actual powerups, combos, and strategies. Here we are talking about depth - which is simply (according to Extra Credits) "the number of emergent experientially different possibilities (or meaningful choices) that come out of one ruleset."
VII. Screenshots

Have at least 2 mockup screens of the game. They can be hand drawn and scanned, Photoshop mockups, or scanned doodles - use <img> tags. You can either display the images in this section, or somewhere else on the page.
VIII. Other

Something else you'd like to say that doesn't fit elsewhere. Also discuss any external libraries you might use. All libraries are subject to Professor approval.
IX. About the developer(s)

Your name/major/minor/year your, skill set and interests (ex. programming, game physics, graphic design, Maya, Photoshop, Illustrator, music, game sound, ...).
Instructions

Overview: Create a living proposal for a 2D casual game you will develop.

"Living proposal" means that the document will be a starting point, but the content will evolve as you work on the game.

Quotes of interest: Why make a plan?

"In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable." - Dwight Eisenhower

"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything." - Dwight Eisenhower

"Fail to plan, plan to fail." - Hillary Clinton

"I'm not making any plans. I'm just going to let the universe surprise me." - John Cusack (Don't listen to him for this project)

Important:

    Use the template in the first part of this document, or an equivalent. The page will be visible at : http://people.rit.edu/yourid/590-ios-game/project-1-proposal.html or on your own server if you wish. Submission: post online, and ZIP and post (HTML & images) to dropbox before due date. Be sure to put actual URL to the online version in the mycourses dopbox comments field.
    Don't overscope this! Be sure it's something you could create a reasonable implementation of in JS in 2-1/2 weeks or so. Not every feature you come up with will have to be in the final game, but the core gameplay should be.
    We've a covered chain reaction game, a simple mobile game, and a sprite shooter in this class, but don't feel constrained to these generes. Platformers, puzzle games, tile-based games, and many other genres are possible. You may have to avail yourself of online tutorials - that's fine - just be sure to cite resources - and do your own coding in the final version.
    Teams of 2 are acceptable for this project. You will need to make sure that both of your names are on the proposal, and you will both need to upload the proposal to mycourses and gibson. Team projects will be held to a higher standard on the grading.
    A simple idea that is well-executed is better than an over-scoped and under-realized concept.
    This is a new course, so I don't have a large bank of HTML5 game projects to show you, but there are some great tutorials and examples online. Google: html5 platformer tutorial, Google: html5 match 3 game tutorial, Google: html5 tile based game tutorial
    This High Concept document example by Ernest Adams might be useful.
    Get some ideas for game names here or here
    The game should be fun. Flappy Birds clones need not apply.
    After you've got a tentative design worked out, start coding!

** Discussion from Project 0 **

Definition: What's a Casual game? Most casual games have similar basic features: (1)

    Extremely simple gameplay, like a puzzle game that can be played entirely using a one-button mouse or cellphone keypad
    Allowing gameplay in short bursts, during work breaks or, in the case of portable and cell phone games, on public transportation
    The ability to quickly reach a final stage, or continuous play with no need to save the game
    Some variant on a "try before you buy" business model or an advertising-based model

Other Common Characteristics: (2)

    Average play sessions of 2 to 5 minutes
    Overall game length a few hours
    Depth of gameplay is emphasized over length - a small number elements are re-combined in unique ways. ex. Plants v. Zombies.
    Repeatability is emphasized over content. Short and exciting play sessions to encourage the player to give it "just one more try"
    Natural play breaks built into game.
    Variety and surprise are built into the game.

Examples:

    Boomshine - abstract chain reaction game
    Bubbles - avoidance game
    Hundreds -avoidance/"just one more try" abstract iOS game
    Squares 2 - abstract avoidance game
    Particle Blaster - Shooter
    Petals - puzzle game
    Pretentious Game - an abstract game with a strong narrative, and a theme of love, loss and persistence.
    Mondrianism - abstract puzzle game
    Koutack - puzzle game
    Zombie Dice - "push your luck" game
