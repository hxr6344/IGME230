## I. High Concept
It's Jelly Bombs of Doom but you can drop bombs to destroy enemies with bombs!

## II. Genre

Action, Casual, Avoidance, Eat or Be Eaten, Survival of Fittest 

## III. Platform
On Desktop.

## IV. Story

Your avatar is running away from larger creatures and eating smaller ones to gain points, and increase in size. 

You play as a volcanic creature trying to survive on your island by eating small molten creatures. Be careful! It's eat or be eaten! To avoid the risk of being eaten because of your size by a larger molten creature, grow in size by eating smaller molten creatures and drop water bombs to destroy larger enemies in your path. Your goal in life, is to try to beat your previous highscores, see how long you can survive and try to be the biggest creature on the food chain. 

But most games at least have a premise to define the action (ex. Your avatar is rusnning from ghosts in a maze).

For your proposed game, discuss the theme (big ideas - if applicable), mood (excitement, fear, ?), narrative (how the player progresses through the game), and premise of the game (what drives the plot).
A continuous level game, where the play has only one life, and when they are eaten by an enemy, the game is over. 

Also discuss player motivation. Give a short summary of what the player is trying to accomplish in the game. Some of this will be recycled from the High Concept section above.

### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"

There are separate instructional scenes, with a tutorial for movement and bomb dropping. 

### Player learning

Explain some of what the player needs to learn to beat the game. Be specific and cite actual powerups, combos, and strategies. Here we are talking about depth - which is simply (according to Extra Credits) "the number of emergent experientially different possibilities (or meaningful choices) that come out of one ruleset."

## VII. Screenshots
Mockups:
Have at least 2 mockup screens of the game. They can be hand drawn and scanned, Photoshop mockups, or scanned doodles - use <img> tags. You can either display the images in this section, or somewhere else on the page.

### Why?
I decided to create this game, because I'm very nostalgia of Jelly Blobs of Dooms. I remember playing for hours with my sister when I was little.  

### External Libraries
I don't know if I will being using External Libraries for this project.
