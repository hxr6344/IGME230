## IV. Story
Your avatar is running away from larger creatures, and dropping water bombs to destroy them. Eating the smaller ones to gain points, and increasing in size. 

The theme is Eat or Be Eaten with fire type creatures on a volcanic island. The mood for the game is a combination of excitement and fear.

You play as a volcanic creature trying to survive on your island by eating small molten creatures. Be careful! It's eat or be eaten! To avoid the risk of being eaten because of your size by a larger molten creature, grow in size by eating smaller molten creatures and drop water bombs to destroy larger enemies in your path. Your goal in life, is to try to beat your previous highscores, see how long you can survive and try to be the biggest creature on the food chain.

## VI. Gameplay
### Mechanics
They chose how fast they move across the screen and when they are touching an enemy, depending on the size, if smaller the player gains points and increases in sprite size. The player can also drop water bombs where they stand, as a trap to destroy enemies that are following. The player has about ten water bombs before it takes about five seconds of reload time to refill their ammuno, so they are using resource management to get out of tricky situations. 

### Controls

Drop Bomb - Space Bar

Move Left - Left Arrow Key, A

Move Right - Right Arrow Key, D

Move Up - Up Arrow Key, W

Move Down - Down Arrow Key, S
 

### Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"

There are separate instructional scenes, with a tutorial for movement and bomb dropping. 

### Player learning
The player need to be able to judge if the smaller enemy can actually be eaten, and is not the same size as the player. If the enemy is the same size then the player will lose. The player needs to use acceleration with caution because it's a wrap around game, where the enemies spawn at the edges, so the player might head straight into a enemy if going way too fast. Also learning how to drop water bombs around the player if there are too much enemies coming from multiple directions. Combining a water trap and accelerating quickly easily can knock out an enemy without stopping to eat an enemy. The strategy is to try and remain around the center of the gameplay so you can see all incoming enemies. If a smaller enemy appears in front a larger enemy, it's a better to avoid the risk but taking that chance will increase the points given.

### Why?
I decided to create this game, because I'm very nostalgia of Jelly Blobs of Dooms. I remember playing for hours with my sister when I was little.
